# Foundations-Java

An implementation of the Foundations programming language, written in Java.
Inspired by the [craftinginterpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) book.

## Learn the Language

In Foundations, every line ends with a semicolon (`;`).

Variables are an important part of every language. To define a variable in Foundations, use the `let` keyword.
```javascript
let variable_name = "variable value";
```
